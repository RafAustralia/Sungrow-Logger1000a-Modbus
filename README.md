Sungrow Logger1000a Modbus File
This file was created because nothing like this has ever been put together so I have put this file to address this issue for my own gear.
It is quite likely the Logger1000a will have new features added in the futire - to the list of its registers, but for now there are no control parameteds available.

NOTES:
Logger is an EMS control device which will organise all equipment and assign each of these connected parts its own modbus number.
Logger typically should sit as modbus number 247, but - I cannot confirm this to be the only variant.
My file is written as modbus_sungrow_247.yaml as that is an easy way of identifying each piece of my equipment if it corresponds to the number it was given.
